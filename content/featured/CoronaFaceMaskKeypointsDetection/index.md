A deep neural network model to [detect in a real-time environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCawXCNhdvI) if people are wearing face masks correctly or not during the Coronavirus pandemic, using Computer Vision. The facial keypoints are also predicted over their Masked/Unmasked faces which can be used for further development, such as driver drowsiness detection while wearing face mask, head pose estimation, etc.
